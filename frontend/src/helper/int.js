/*
So the first thing you want to be able to do is to identify a problem that uses a sliding window paradigm. Luckily, there are some common giveaways:


-The problem will involve a data structure that is ordered and iterable like an array or a string

-You are looking for some subrange in that array/string, like a longest, shortest or target value.

-There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in O(NÂ²), O(2^N) or some other large time complexity.

-But the biggest giveaway is that
