# Router - Better prepare

## Codecool Full-Stack API final exam project

A developmental MERN-stack web app, created heavily with React, and Express.

The app is live at: <a href="https://thunderous-concha-3ba15b.netlify.app/">Router - Better prepare</a>

## _Notes on how to use the map in v1.0.0_ üí¨

- You can zoom in-out or click&drag the map at any time

1. Click the "line-string" tool on the right hand side of the map
2. Click anywhere on the map to set your route's **starting point**

- Optional: click additional checkpoints along your route

3. Click anywhere on the map to set your route's **ending point**
4. Click again on the same spot or hit **Enter** to finish

- Now you'll see the recommended route and the weather info along
- Feel free to zoom or move the map

5. ‚ùóÔ∏è _Before you start drawing a new route, ALWAYS click the_ üóë _"trash-tool" first_

## User story

```
"As a cyclist, I want to see how the weather will change on my ride, so I can better prepare."
```

## Theme of the project

The base idea of this project is coming from personal experience. Every time I'm planning to go out for a bicycle training session (or back when I was doing food delivery) I curiously scan the sky, analyze weather forecasts and try to figure out how to best prepare. Especially if conditions look uncertain. Nobody wants to get caught in the rain, heavy wind, or choking humidity and has nothing in their pockets to ease the situation. It would be very useful to precisely foresee all the possible weather changes on your exact route planned for the day.

## Features of version 1.0.0

- geolocate the user on site load
- draw your route in an integrated Mapbox map (using points)
- the app gives you a recommended route (without navigation)
- OpenWeather provides 4 or 5 forecast points along your route
  - at the exact time the map estimates you to be there
  - including: sky conditions, temperature (metric), wind speed, humidity, expected volume of rain
- users can login using their Google account
  - and register with a username
- logged in users can save this route (with all relevant data) into their private profile page
  - saved routes can be made public (for "Feed" in v2.0.0)

## Planned features of version 2.0.0

- browse public routes (shared by users)
- filter public routes
- display a "T-Factor" based on how difficult were the weather conditions on your ride
- display wind direction
- unique route names

## Setup requirements

- Terminal
- Visual Studio Code
- Web browser
